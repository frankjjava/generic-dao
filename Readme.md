## Generic Dao
-----------

Spring JDBC template gives unbeatable performance when compared to any ORM framework.

This component saves a developer from writing all the code requried to integrate with a RDBMS backend.

The developer has to only extend the otc.framework.generic.dao.AbstractDaoImpl and call one of the executeXXX(...) methods.

//TODO - documentation is WIP.
